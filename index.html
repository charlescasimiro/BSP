            <p class="lead text-muted mb-3">Through a sequence of plenary talks and technical panels, the event will discuss distributed signal processing from different aspects and for different applications. These include, but are not limited to, distributed optimization and learning, cooperation, consensus update, fully distributed versus federated learning, distributed computations for communications applications, distributed monitoring systems, and privacy issues.</p>
            <p class="lead text-muted mb-3"> Named as the first Brazilian Signal Processing Forum, this event will target mainly an academic audience. All talks and panels will be recorded, and all the slides and video will be made available to the Signal Processing Society Resource Center, if approved. There will be no written proceedings, nor paper submission.</p>
            <p class="lead text-muted mb-3"> We believe the technical aspects discussed will bring the attention of students and lecturers to the possibilities and services brought by the Signal Processing Society. In particular, we target the academic audience pursuing advanced studies in Electrical Engineering.</p>
            <p class="lead text-muted mb-3"> There will be registration, but no registration fee for this event. </p>
            <p class="lead text-muted mb-3"> The event will be hybrid, therefore those who have registered and cannot attend at the venue will be allowed to participate remotely. All talks and panels will be recorded and made available to the SPS society.</p>

      <p class="text-muted mb-3"><b>Abstract:</b> Telecom fibers are ubiquitous in urban environments. They are reliable, durable, and much of them can be upgraded to support smart cities applications in a cost-effective manner. Indeed, with Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS), one can turn existing roadside fiber-optic telecommunication cables into vibration sensors with metric spatial resolution over sensing range exceeding 100 km. Thanks to Artificial Intelligence, potential applications of DAS are only limited by imagination. In this talk, we shall propose an overview on Machine Learning algorithms for DAS data processing with applications to smart cities supervision, in particular real-time traffic monitoring.</p>

      <h5 class="titulo text-center" id="palestrante">Prof. Carlo Fischione (KTH, Stockholm)</h5>
      <p class="text-muted mb-3"><b>Abstract:</b> In the recent years, the need of running machine learning (ML) services over wireless communication networks has promoted the design of new wireless communication protocols capable to efficiently support such ML services. In fact, in wireless networks, ML services face major challenges in terms of computation, bandwidth, scalability, privacy, and security. One proposal to overcome such challenges is Over-the-air computation (OAC), which is a known technique where wireless devices transmit values by analog amplitude modulation so that a function of these values (e.g., Federated Learning gradient aggregations) is computed over the communication channel at a common receiver. OAC dramatically reduces communication energy use, amplify spectrum efficiency of several order of magnitudes, and achieve privacy protections. The physical reason is the superposition properties of the electromagnetic waves, which naturally return sums of analog values. Consequently, the applications of OAC are almost entirely restricted to analog communication systems. However, the use of digital communications for OAC would have several benefits, such as error correction, synchronization, acquisition of channel state information, and easier adoption by current digital communication systems. Nevertheless, a common belief is that digital modulations are generally unfeasible for computation tasks because the overlapping of digitally modulated signals returns, in general, meaningless values. In this talk, we will break through such belief and present a fundamentally new computing method, named ChannelComp, for performing OAC by any digital modulation. We will show how digital modulation formats allow us to compute a wider class of functions than OAC can compute, and we propose a feasibility optimization problem that ascertains the optimal digital modulation for computing functions over the-air. We show by simulation the superior performance of ChannelComp in comparison to OAC.</p>

      <h5 class="titulo text-center" id="palestrante"> Professor Marios Kountouris (University of Granada, Spain &amp; EURECOM, France)</h5>
      <p class="text-muted mb-3"><b>Abstract:</b> Future communication systems are evolving to cater to cyber-physical and decentralized interactive systems, such as swarm robotics, self-driving cars, and smart Internet of Things (IoT). The interconnection of myriad sensing- and learning-empowered devices will underpin the global functioning of our societies, enabling formidable progress in various sectors. The realization of this euphoric dream however hinges upon networks’ ability to deliver on an unprecedented number of highly demanding requirements. As we are entering the era of networked intelligence, fundamental advances are necessary to satisfy the pressing requirements for real-time communication, timely autonomous decision-making, and effective distributed processing. A promising step forward toward effective communication is goal-oriented semantic communication; a paradigm shift that aims at redefining data importance and timing, looking through the prism of the semantics of information. We highlight fundamental concepts, essential principles, and key functionalities required for effectively conveying only information representations and features, which are timely, relevant, and valuable for achieving end users’ goals. We discuss several recent theoretical results in the realm of rate-distortion-perception theory, timely source coding, pull-based communication, and relativistic information transfer. We conclude this talk by discussing the potential and the technical challenges associated with this promising avenue of research.</p>
